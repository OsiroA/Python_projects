# Personal Diary Challenge

## Introduction
The Personal Diary Challenge is a Python program designed to help users manage their personal diary digitally. It allows users to securely register, login, add diary entries, and view past entries, providing a convenient and organized way to keep track of personal thoughts and experiences.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to offer users a simple yet effective tool for maintaining a personal diary in the digital age. By providing features such as secure user authentication and easy entry management, the program aims to streamline the diary-keeping process and encourage users to journal regularly.

## Features
- **User Registration**: Securely register new users with hashed passwords and randomly generated salts for enhanced security.
- **User Login**: Authenticate users with their credentials before granting access to diary functionalities.
- **Add Entry**: Easily add new diary entries with timestamps for accurate record-keeping.
- **View Entries**: View the most recent diary entry or search for entries by specific dates.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the backend logic and user interface.
- **Replit**: Database storage solution utilized for storing user credentials and diary entries securely.
- **getpass**: Library used for secure password input during user authentication.

## Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges faced during the project was implementing secure user authentication while ensuring a smooth user experience. This involved securely hashing passwords and managing salts to prevent unauthorized access to user accounts. Additionally, designing an intuitive user interface for adding and viewing diary entries required careful consideration of user interactions and feedback.
