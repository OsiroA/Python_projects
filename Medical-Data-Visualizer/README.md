Sure, here is an example of a possible README file for this code:

# Medical Examination Data Analysis

This code performs data analysis on a dataset containing medical examination results for a group of patients. The analysis includes adding a new column to identify overweight patients, normalizing some columns, filtering the data to remove outliers, and visualizing some features with categorical plots and a heatmap.

## Installation

The following packages need to be installed to run the code:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- numpy

To install the packages using pip, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy
```

## Usage

The `medical_examination.csv` file should be placed in the same directory as the `medical_examination.py` script.

The code contains two functions that generate plots:

- `draw_cat_plot()`: This function generates a categorical plot showing the prevalence of different health conditions among patients with and without cardiovascular disease.
- `draw_heat_map()`: This function generates a heatmap showing the correlation between different health measurements.

To use these functions, simply call them from the Python shell or another script. For example:

```python
from medical_examination import draw_cat_plot, draw_heat_map

# Generate the categorical plot
fig_cat = draw_cat_plot()

# Save the figure to a file
fig_cat.savefig('cat_plot.png')

# Generate the heatmap
fig_heat = draw_heat_map()

# Save the figure to a file
fig_heat.savefig('heatmap.png')
```
