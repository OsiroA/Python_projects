# Hangman Challenge

## Introduction
Hangman Challenge is a simple Python game where players guess letters to uncover a hidden word. The purpose of the game is to provide entertainment and challenge players' word-guessing skills.

## Problem and Purpose
The game serves as a fun way to pass the time while also exercising cognitive abilities such as pattern recognition and deductive reasoning. It provides a nostalgic experience for those familiar with the classic hangman game and offers an opportunity for players to compete with themselves or others to guess words within a limited number of attempts.

## Technologies and Libraries Used
- Python: Programming language used to develop the game.
- Random module: Used to select a random word from a predefined list.
- Input/output functions: Used to interact with the player through the command line.

## Code Repository
The code repository for Hangman Challenge is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/OsiroA/Python_projects/tree/main/hangmanGame).

## Challenges Faced
One challenge encountered during development was ensuring the game's logic accurately tracked the player's progress and updated the display of the hidden word accordingly. This required careful consideration of data structures and iteration techniques to efficiently manage the game state. By breaking down the problem into smaller tasks and testing each component rigorously, the challenge was successfully overcome.
