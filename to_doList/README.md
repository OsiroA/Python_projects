# To-Do List Manager

## Author: Osiro Asunde

### Description:
The To-Do List Manager is a Python script designed to help users organize their tasks efficiently. It allows users to add, edit, remove, and view tasks, with the option to prioritize tasks based on urgency. This project aims to streamline task management and enhance productivity by providing a simple yet effective tool for managing to-do lists.

### Problem Statement:
Keeping track of tasks and priorities can be challenging, especially when managing multiple responsibilities. This project addresses the need for an organized system to manage tasks effectively, ensuring that important tasks are not overlooked and deadlines are met consistently.

### Technologies and Libraries Used:
- Python: Programming language used for the development of the script.
- Operating System (os) module: Used for system operations like clearing the screen.
- Time module: Used for adding delays in the script.
- Git: Version control system for managing project files.

### Code Repository:
The source code for this project is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/OsiroA/Python_projects/tree/main/to_doList).

### Challenges Faced and Solutions:
1. **User Input Validation**: Ensuring that users provide valid input for task attributes such as priority and due date was a challenge. Solution: Implemented input validation checks and provided informative error messages to guide users.
2. **Menu Navigation**: Designing an intuitive menu system for navigating through different options posed a challenge. Solution: Organized the menu options logically and provided clear instructions for each option to improve user experience.
3. **Clearing Screen**: Clearing the screen for better user interface presented a challenge due to platform differences. Solution: Utilized the `os` module to clear the screen in a platform-independent manner, ensuring consistent behavior across different operating systems.

### Usage:
1. Clone the repository:
